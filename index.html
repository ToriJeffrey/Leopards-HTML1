            <h2>Diet and hunting</h2>
            <p>Leopards are carnivores; animals which eat meat. They prey on a wide range of creatures including: gazelles, antelopes, jackals, sheep, rodents, monkeys, wildebeest and birds. Leopards mainly hunt at night. They will attempt to get as close as possible to their prey without alerting them, and in the right moment they will strike from their hiding place. Their prey is then killed via suffocation.</p>
